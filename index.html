    <h1>sam dvorin</h1>
<p>Sam Dvorin is a Boston-based artist who is excited about all forms of music. <br>
      His activities include conducting chamber groups, playing drums in a punk band, composing chamber operas, and producing experimental noise music (among other things). <br>
      Dvorin, born in 2002, is currently focusing on collaboration across artistic mediums, especially ones that give a human element to his art (movement, spoken word, etc). <br>
      Influenced by his DIY music roots and his study with Joshua Fineberg at Boston University, Dvorin’s compositions deal with the hypnotic, neurotic, and microscopic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;…Being on a recent Phill Niblock kick, I was prepared to seek deeply for the beauty in the resonance of dvorin's sustained tones and bright drones on "Bassoon Trio No. 3 I" <br>
  With the cicada hum on the background and my speakers cranked to 11, unfolding paths of sound emanate from the core as drones cross and harmonize with each other. <br>
  Written for a string quartet with just intonation, dvorin states, "the themes slowly wax and wane in and out of tune in a hypotonic picture devoid of time." Well said and lovely work….</p>
