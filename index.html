<blockquote>
  <p>Sam Dvorin is a Boston-based artist who is excited about all forms of music. <br>
  His activities include conducting chamber groups, playing drums in a punk band, composing chamber operas, and producing experimental noise music (among other things). <br>
  Dvorin, born in 2002, is currently focusing on collaboration across artistic mediums, especially ones that give a human element to his art (movement, spoken word, etc). <br>
  Influenced by his DIY music roots and his study with Joshua Fineberg at Boston University, Dvorinâ€™s compositions deal with the hypnotic, neurotic, and microscopic.&nbsp;</p>
